# What is this?

This repo contains two files: 

1) an xlsx file with all True/False questions from all available Info 1 midterms and final exams up until HS23, excluding the final exam of HS23.
2) a Python code to print the questions in the terminal and prompt the user to answer.

# How to run

If the two files are in the same directory you can either run the code directly in your IDE or from the command line. It will print questions in the terminal and prompt you to answer with "True" or "False", casing does not matter. Here is an example:

`Question: A function that raises an exception returns None.\n
Your answer (True/False): false\n

Correct!`

Please note that the code shuffles the questions for each run, but does not log the answers.
